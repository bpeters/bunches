This is a first try on an android version of react-native-camera.
There is no functionality besides a "camera view" so please dont use this for anything serious.
There is an example project for android in the `example` directory.

Steps to add this to your react-native android project:
* `npm install https://github.com/timmh/react-native-camera.git`
* add to your `settings.gradle`:
```
include ':com.lwansbrough.ReactCamera'
project(':com.lwansbrough.ReactCamera').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../node_modules/react-native-camera/android')
```
* add to your `app/build.gradle`:
```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile project(':com.lwansbrough.ReactCamera')
}
```
* add to your `MainActivity.java`:
	* `import com.facebook.react.CompositeReactPackage;`
	* `import com.lwansbrough.ReactCamera.ReactCameraPackage;`
	* in `onCreate`:
	```
	mReactInstanceManager = ReactInstanceManager.builder()
		...
		.addPackage(new ReactCameraPackage(this))
		...
	```
